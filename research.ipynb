1 organizing a large number of music into different groups (genres) based on the features of the music

2 it's unsupervised because we just give it the musics we won't give any answer to it or we won't label the musics given to it.
due to that it start to find the structures similarity and differences by itself

3 outline of the ML workflow
first define what our goal is
gather all audios we want to sort
convert sound to data :- since computer doesn't listen to music we'll change the music features like pitch,beat,frequency & e.t.c into numbers
cleaning the data
train the model
evaluate the result
deploy it
maintainance

4 this model might fail due to usage of wrong features(the data we extracted from the music)
it's like if we use only insufficient traits like loudness and speed it might end up sorting two different generes together
how to fix it
add more complex music features
if possible analyze lyrics
and the tester should be human so we can make sure the sorted playlist match people's perspective so we can ensure the features we used are right
